## Business description
Design a data model of the menu and/or the dishes.A dish should contain:
- name
- short description
- price
- category (starter, main course, dessert, beverage, ...)
- when it is available based on time of day (breakfast, dinner, lunch, weekdays/- ends)
- it should be able to deactivate a dish, for example when itâ€™s sold out
- how long the guest approximately has to wait for the dish after they order

Create a REST API
- Save (Create/Update) dishes to the MongoDB
- Load dished from the API
